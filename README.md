# Orbmacs

Orbmacs is my relatively simple emacs init file, so called because of the dashboard image. It is my personal evolution of Witchmacs, and will be continually updated with changes I make.
I would encourage you to create your own fork of this repository, as not all changes may be to your liking.

# Installation

Open emacs and install org 9.5 from elpa.

Then run in a terminal
git clone https://github.com/kvvba/orbmacs.git ~/.emacs.d

Either restart emacs at this point or simply use M-x load-file, and point it to ~/.emacs.d/init.el

All done!

# Notes
