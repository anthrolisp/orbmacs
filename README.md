# Orbmacs

![O R B](https://github.com/kvvba/orbmacs/blob/ed9e8d190ea64375a8bc5af083aae321d57975c7/logo/orb.png?raw=true)

Orbmacs is an emacs configuration. 

# Installation
Run in a terminal
`git clone https://github.com/kvvba/orbmacs.git ~/.emacs.d`

Either restart emacs at this point or simply use `M-x load-file`, and point it to `~/.emacs.d/init.el`

# Notes

I'm using the GTD method of organisation. If you do not like GTD, remove the parts relating to it in: agenda files, refile targets, and capture templates.

If you wish to use mu4e you will need to write your own config for it.

Default folders (you need to create these yourself if you do not have them)
- Org agenda: `~/org`
- Org journal: `~/org/journal`
- Org roam: `~/RoamNotes`
- Bongo: `~/Music/`
